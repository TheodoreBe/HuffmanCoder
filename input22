   It all started when our uber geek, Bill Brasky, woke up in a bush. It was the sixth time it had happened. Feeling barely concerned, Bill Brasky deflowered a potato, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Suddenly inspired by the wise teachings of Confuscious, he realized that his beloved iPad was missing!  Immediately he called his undeclared soulmate, Leroy Jenkins. Bill Brasky had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were electric ones.  Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was outgoing though sometimes a little... oafish. Bill Brasky called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.

   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very unctuous Bill Brasky. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most spotted wolf hamsters yawn before mating, yet spotted wolf hamsters usually scandalously sneeze *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky?  Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the iPad only seven days prior.  It was a flamboyant little iPad... how could he resist?

   It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: his iPad. Leroy Jenkins yawned. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the iPad. Bill Brasky grabbed his George Foreman grill and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the iPad and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the pimp fresh, candy-painted 'Lac, he had take at least four minutes before Bill Brasky would get there.  But if he took the Segway?  Then Leroy Jenkins would be ridiculously screwed.

   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by five annoying marmots that were lured by his iPad. Leroy Jenkins belched; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling relieved, he recklessly reached for his gerbil and aptly punched every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the disease-infested jungle, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the Segway rolling up.  It was Bill Brasky.

----o0o---- 

   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at IHOP to pick up a 12-pack of gerbils, so he knew he was running late.  With a skillful leap, Bill Brasky was out of the Segway and went surreptitiously jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Leroy Jenkins was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the iPad into a box of gerbils and then slid the box behind his whale. Leroy Jenkins was pleased but at least the iPad was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins surreptitiously purred.  With a careful push, Bill Brasky opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some annoying rationality-deprived retard in a tricycle,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Bill Brasky took a seat RIGHT next to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the iPad. Leroy Jenkins panicked trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Bill Brasky was distracted. Suddenly inspired by the wise teachings of Confuscious, Leroy Jenkins noticed a annoying look on Bill Brasky's face. Bill Brasky slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his scalp when Bill Brasky asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the iPad right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A annoying look started to form on Bill Brasky's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's potatos from when she used to have pet Indonesian devil cats.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Bill Brasky nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Bill Brasky thoughtfully lunged toward the box and opened it.  The iPad was plainly in view.

   Bill Brasky stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been ten nanoseconds. Ever so extemperaneously, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Bill Brasky's direction, clearly desperate. Bill Brasky grabbed the iPad and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a enchanting chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Bill Brasky,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little pestering, so Bill Brasky knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking bananas at him or something. Ever so extemperaneously, he gripped his iPad tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Bill Brasky. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame two days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Bill Brasky. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Bill Brasky was gone.

----o0o---- 

   Just yonder, Bill Brasky was struggling to make his way through the fanstic pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Bill Brasky had severely hurt his ear during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral marmots suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the iPad.  One by one they latched on to Bill Brasky.  Already weakened from his injury, Bill Brasky yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of marmots running off with his iPad.

   About seven hours later, Bill Brasky awoke, his prostate throbbing.  It was dark and Bill Brasky did not know where he was.  Deep in the enchanting secret vineyard, Bill Brasky was alarmingly lost. Suddenly cheered up by the Hamtaro theme song, he remembered that his iPad was taken by the marmots. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life.  That's when, to his horror, a little marmot emerged from the bush.  It was the alpha marmot. Bill Brasky opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the marmot sunk its teeth into Bill Brasky's love handle. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Bill Brasky's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.

   Less than ten miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the iPad.  'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened wolverine.  With a inept thrust, he buried it deeply into his armpit.  As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Bill Brasky... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him.  But he would die alone that day.  All that remained was the iPad that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise.  And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant marmots, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come.  Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead.  So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(

   It all started when our uber geek, Bill Brasky, woke up in a imaginery desert. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling really pleased, Bill Brasky punched a carrot, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Giggling like schoolgirl, he realized that his beloved cheickne was missing!  Immediately he called his bed-friend, Leroy Jenkins. Bill Brasky had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) 61 years, the majority of which were electric ones.  Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was smart though sometimes a little... funny-smelling. Bill Brasky called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.

   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very unhappy Bill Brasky. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most spotted wolf hamsters grimace before mating, yet man-eating capybaras usually explosively grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky?  Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the cheickne only six days prior.  It was a striking little cheickne... how could he resist?

   It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the cheickne. Bill Brasky grabbed his hammock and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the cheickne and he had to do it carefully. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the time machine, he had take at least seven minutes before Bill Brasky would get there.  But if he took the hogg?  Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.

   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by six funny-smelling dogss that were lured by his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling angered, he randomly reached for his gerbil and deftly poked every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the secret vineyard, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the hogg rolling up.  It was Bill Brasky.

----o0o---- 

   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at The Salvation Army to pick up a 12-pack of wolverines, so he knew he was running late.  With a mighty leap, Bill Brasky was out of the hogg and went earnestly jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Leroy Jenkins was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the cheickne into a box of live hand grenades and then slid the box behind his hammock. Leroy Jenkins was displeased but at least the cheickne was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins explosively purred.  With a quick push, Bill Brasky opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some dimwitted genocidal maniac in a tricked out go kart,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Bill Brasky took a seat about two saucy furlongs from where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Bill Brasky was distracted. Suddenly cheered up by the Hamtaro theme song, Leroy Jenkins noticed a insensitive look on Bill Brasky's face. Bill Brasky slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his ear when Bill Brasky asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the cheickne right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?

Bill Brasky nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Bill Brasky skillfully lunged toward the box and opened it.  The cheickne was plainly in view.

   Bill Brasky stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been nine nanoseconds. Like a drunken sailor at happy hour, Leroy Jenkins groped flamboyantly in Bill Brasky's direction, clearly desperate. Bill Brasky grabbed the cheickne and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a electric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Bill Brasky,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little oafish, so Bill Brasky knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking gerbils at him or something. In a blinding moment of misguided bravado, he gripped his cheickne tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Bill Brasky.

----o0o---- 

   Just yonder, Bill Brasky was struggling to make his way through the disease-infested jungle behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Bill Brasky had severely hurt his fingernail during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral dogss suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the cheickne.  One by one they latched on to Bill Brasky.  Already weakened from his injury, Bill Brasky yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of dogss running off with his cheickne.

   But then God came down with His charismatic smile and restored Bill Brasky's cheickne. Feeling puzzled, God smote the dogss for their injustice.  Then He got in His pimp fresh, candy-painted 'Lac and jettisoned away with the fortitude of  20 disease-carrying chipmunks running from a shrunken pack of venomous koalas. Bill Brasky danced with joy when he saw this. His cheickne was safe. It was a good thing, too, because in nine minutes his favorite TV show,  Two and a Half Men, was going to come on (followed immediately by 'When venomous koalas meet weapon of mass destruction'). Bill Brasky was excited. And so, everyone except Leroy Jenkins and a few bloody glove-toting spotted wolf hamsters lived blissfully happy, forever after.

Leroy Jenkins let out a electric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Bill Brasky,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little oafish, so Bill Brasky knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking gerbils at him or something. In a blinding moment of misguided bravado, he gripped his cheickne tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Bill Brasky. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame four days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Bill Brasky. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Bill Brasky was gone.

----o0o---- 

   Just yonder, Bill Brasky was struggling to make his way through the disease-infested jungle behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Bill Brasky had severely hurt his fingernail during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral dogss suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the cheickne.  One by one they latched on to Bill Brasky.  Already weakened from his injury, Bill Brasky yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of dogss running off with his cheickne.

   But then God came down with His charismatic smile and restored Bill Brasky's cheickne. Feeling puzzled, God smote the dogss for their injustice.  Then He got in His pimp fresh, candy-painted 'Lac and jettisoned away with the fortitude of  20 disease-carrying chipmunks running from a shrunken pack of venomous koalas. Bill Brasky danced with joy when he saw this. His cheickne was safe. It was a good thing, too, because in nine minutes his favorite TV show,  Two and a Half Men, was going to come on (followed immediately by 'When venomous koalas meet weapon of mass destruction'). Bill Brasky was excited. And so, everyone except Leroy Jenkins and a few bloody glove-toting spotted wolf hamsters lived blissfully happy, forever after.

*** Forever pwning with earnest.   It all started when our uber geek, Bill Brasky, woke up in a imaginery desert. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling really pleased, Bill Brasky punched a carrot, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Giggling like schoolgirl, he realized that his beloved cheickne was missing!  Immediately he called his bed-friend, Leroy Jenkins. Bill Brasky had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) 61 years, the majority of which were electric ones.  Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was smart though sometimes a little... funny-smelling. Bill Brasky called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.

   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very unhappy Bill Brasky. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most spotted wolf hamsters grimace before mating, yet man-eating capybaras usually explosively grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky?  Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the cheickne only six days prior.  It was a striking little cheickne... how could he resist?

   It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the cheickne. Bill Brasky grabbed his hammock and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the cheickne and he had to do it carefully. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the time machine, he had take at least seven minutes before Bill Brasky would get there.  But if he took the hogg?  Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.

   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by six funny-smelling dogss that were lured by his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling angered, he randomly reached for his gerbil and deftly poked every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the secret vineyard, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the hogg rolling up.  It was Bill Brasky.

----o0o---- 

   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at The Salvation Army to pick up a 12-pack of wolverines, so he knew he was running late.  With a mighty leap, Bill Brasky was out of the hogg and went earnestly jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Leroy Jenkins was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the cheickne into a box of live hand grenades and then slid the box behind his hammock. Leroy Jenkins was displeased but at least the cheickne was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins explosively purred.  With a quick push, Bill Brasky opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some dimwitted genocidal maniac in a tricked out go kart,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Bill Brasky took a seat about two saucy furlongs from where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Bill Brasky was distracted. Suddenly cheered up by the Hamtaro theme song, Leroy Jenkins noticed a insensitive look on Bill Brasky's face. Bill Brasky slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his ear when Bill Brasky asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the cheickne right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A oafish look started to form on Bill Brasky's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's bananas from when she used to have pet Indonesian devil cats.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Bill Brasky nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Bill Brasky skillfully lunged toward the box and opened it.  The cheickne was plainly in view.

   Bill Brasky stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been nine nanoseconds.

Not thinking, he tossed the cheickne into a box of live hand grenades and then slid the box behind his hammock. Leroy Jenkins was displeased but at least the cheickne was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins explosively purred.  With a quick push, Bill Brasky opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some dimwitted genocidal maniac in a tricked out go kart,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Bill Brasky took a seat about two saucy furlongs from where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Bill Brasky was distracted. Suddenly cheered up by the Hamtaro theme song, Leroy Jenkins noticed a insensitive look on Bill Brasky's face. Bill Brasky slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his ear when Bill Brasky asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the cheickne right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A oafish look started to form on Bill Brasky's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's bananas from when she used to have pet Indonesian devil cats.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Bill Brasky nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Bill Brasky skillfully lunged toward the box and opened it.  The cheickne was plainly in view.

   Bill Brasky stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been nine nanoseconds. Like a drunken sailor at happy hour, Leroy Jenkins groped flamboyantly in Bill Brasky's direction, clearly desperate. Bill Brasky grabbed the cheickne and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a electric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Bill Brasky,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little oafish, so Bill Brasky knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking gerbils at him or something. In a blinding moment of misguided bravado, he gripped his cheickne tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Bill Brasky. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame four days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Bill Brasky. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Bill Brasky was gone.

----o0o---- 

   Just yonder, Bill Brasky was struggling to make his way through the disease-infested jungle behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Bill Brasky had severely hurt his fingernail during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral dogss suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the cheickne.  One by one they latched on to Bill Brasky.  Already weakened from his injury, Bill Brasky yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of dogss running off with his cheickne.

   But then God came down with His charismatic smile and restored Bill Brasky's cheickne. Feeling puzzled, God smote the dogss for their injustice.  Then He got in His pimp fresh, candy-painted 'Lac and jettisoned away with the fortitude of  20 disease-carrying chipmunks running from a shrunken pack of venomous koalas. Bill Brasky danced with joy when he saw this. His cheickne was safe. It was a good thing, too, because in nine minutes his favorite TV show,  Two and a Half Men, was going to come on (followed immediately by 'When venomous koalas meet weapon of mass destruction'). Bill Brasky was excited. And so, everyone except Leroy Jenkins and a few bloody glove-toting spotted wolf hamsters lived blissfully happy, forever after.

*** Forever pwning with earnest.   It all started when our uber geek, Bill Brasky, woke up in a imaginery desert. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling really pleased, Bill Brasky punched a carrot, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Giggling like schoolgirl, he realized that his beloved cheickne was missing!  Immediately he called his bed-friend, Leroy Jenkins. Bill Brasky had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) 61 years, the majority of which were electric ones.  Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was smart though sometimes a little... funny-smelling. Bill Brasky called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.

   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very unhappy Bill Brasky. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most spotted wolf hamsters grimace before mating, yet man-eating capybaras usually explosively grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky?  Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the cheickne only six days prior.  It was a striking little cheickne... how could he resist?

   It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the cheickne. Bill Brasky grabbed his hammock and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the cheickne and he had to do it carefully. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the time machine, he had take at least seven minutes before Bill Brasky would get there.  But if he took the hogg?  Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.

   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by six funny-smelling dogss that were lured by his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling angered, he randomly reached for his gerbil and deftly poked every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the secret vineyard, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the hogg rolling up.  It was Bill Brasky.

Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most spotted wolf hamsters grimace before mating, yet man-eating capybaras usually explosively grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky?  Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the cheickne only six days prior.  It was a striking little cheickne... how could he resist?

   It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the cheickne. Bill Brasky grabbed his hammock and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the cheickne and he had to do it carefully. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the time machine, he had take at least seven minutes before Bill Brasky would get there.  But if he took the hogg?  Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.

   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by six funny-smelling dogss that were lured by his cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling angered, he randomly reached for his gerbil and deftly poked every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the secret vineyard, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the hogg rolling up.  It was Bill Brasky.

----o0o---- 

   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at The Salvation Army to pick up a 12-pack of wolverines, so he knew he was running late.  With a mighty leap, Bill Brasky was out of the hogg and went earnestly jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Leroy Jenkins was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the cheickne into a box of live hand grenades and then slid the box behind his hammock. Leroy Jenkins was displeased but at least the cheickne was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins explosively purred.  With a quick push, Bill Brasky opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some dimwitted genocidal maniac in a tricked out go kart,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Bill Brasky took a seat about two saucy furlongs from where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the cheickne. Leroy Jenkins yawned trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Bill Brasky was distracted. Suddenly cheered up by the Hamtaro theme song, Leroy Jenkins noticed a insensitive look on Bill Brasky's face. Bill Brasky slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his ear when Bill Brasky asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the cheickne right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A oafish look started to form on Bill Brasky's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's bananas from when she used to have pet Indonesian devil cats.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Bill Brasky nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Bill Brasky skillfully lunged toward the box and opened it.  The cheickne was plainly in view.

   Bill Brasky stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been nine nanoseconds. Like a drunken sailor at happy hour, Leroy Jenkins groped flamboyantly in Bill Brasky's direction, clearly desperate. Bill Brasky grabbed the cheickne and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a electric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Bill Brasky,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little oafish, so Bill Brasky knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking gerbils at him or something. In a blinding moment of misguided bravado, he gripped his cheickne tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Bill Brasky. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame four days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Bill Brasky. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Bill Brasky was gone.

----o0o---- 

   Just yonder, Bill Brasky was struggling to make his way through the disease-infested jungle behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Bill Brasky had severely hurt his fingernail during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral dogss suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the cheickne.  One by one they latched on to Bill Brasky.  Already weakened from his injury, Bill Brasky yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of dogss running off with his cheickne.

   But then God came down with His charismatic smile and restored Bill Brasky's cheickne. Feeling puzzled, God smote the dogss for their injustice.  Then He got in His pimp fresh, candy-painted 'Lac and jettisoned away with the fortitude of  20 disease-carrying chipmunks running from a shrunken pack of venomous koalas. Bill Brasky danced with joy when he saw this. His cheickne was safe. It was a good thing, too, because in nine minutes his favorite TV show,  Two and a Half Men, was going to come on (followed immediately by 'When venomous koalas meet weapon of mass destruction'). Bill Brasky was excited. And so, everyone except Leroy Jenkins and a few bloody glove-toting spotted wolf hamsters lived blissfully happy, forever after.
